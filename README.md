# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases, with a growing prevalence worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes play a critical role in preventing severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. 

- **Type 1 Diabetes**: Caused by the pancreas failing to produce sufficient insulin.  
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: Begins with insulin resistance, a condition where cells do not respond properly to insulin.  

### Global Statistics
- **2015**: 415 million people living with diabetes globally (8.3% of adults).  
- **2021**: 537 million people living with diabetes globally (10.5% of adults).  
  - Type 2 diabetes accounts for ~90% of cases.
- **2045 (Projection)**: 783 million adults (~1 in 8) expected to live with diabetes, a 46% increase from 2021.  
- Diabetes is one of the **top 10 causes of death**, with a **95% increase in mortality rates** from 2000 to 2021.  
- **Global healthcare costs** for diabetes: Estimated at $760 billion annually.

The prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, affecting men and women equally. It is currently the **7th leading cause of death worldwide**.

## Objective

Leveraging advancements in data science and machine learning, this project aims to build a predictive model for assessing diabetes risk. This model will:  
- Assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diabetes.  
- Enhance the community's ability to prevent the disease.  
- Improve overall healthcare quality and raise awareness about diabetes prevention.

## Methodology

We will use data analysis and machine learning techniques to:
1. Analyze key health indicators related to diabetes.
2. Develop a predictive model using algorithms such as **k-NN**, **Naive Bayes**, or **Random Forest**.
3. Evaluate the model's performance to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

By implementing this project, we aim to contribute to better medical care and increased awareness of diabetes prevention.
